# API surface

`warehouse-ops-agent` has no `apis/openapi.yaml` — its surface is small
enough that it is documented here in prose rather than generated. Every
route is a `GET`, and neither surface is authenticated (see
[ADR 0006](./adr/0006-fleet-wide-auth-removal.md)). This page is kept current
by hand; if it drifts from `internal/adapters/inbound/`, the code is
authoritative.

## REST (`internal/adapters/inbound/http`)

| Method & path | What it returns |
|---|---|
| `GET /healthz` | `{"status": "ok"}` |
| `GET /daily-brief` | The full synthesized `DailyBrief`: every monitored site's paths with backlog/staffing/queue/stuck-task facts, plus ranked `openExceptions`. |
| `GET /flow-balance/{pathId}?buildingId=&shiftId=` | The E1 `FlowBalanceException` correlation for one path; `buildingId`/`shiftId` scope the workforce-management staffing-gap lookup. Optionally arbitrated by the ADR-0004 LLM reasoner (`LLM_MODE`) and enriched with the ADR-0008 labor-utilization correlation. 400 on a use-case error; 503 if the use case isn't wired. |
| `GET /explain-travel-factor?pathId=&fromLocationCode=&toLocationCode=` | Calls facility-layout's `estimate_travel_distance` for the two REQUIRED, caller-supplied location codes and classifies the result (`travel_significant`/`travel_negligible`) against the ADR-0009 threshold. 400 if either location code is missing; 503 if the use case isn't wired. This agent never infers the two location codes itself — see [ADR 0009](./adr/0009-explain-travel-factor.md). |
| `GET /console/orders/{id}/lifecycle` | The **console-bff** read model (see [ADR 0002](./adr/0002-micro-frontend-console-architecture.md)): fans out to order-management, inventory-storage, wes-work-planning, and fulfillment-execution and stitches one order's cross-service lifecycle for `warehouse-console`'s Order Lifecycle screen. Each stage degrades independently — one context being unreachable never 500s the whole response. |
| `GET /console/reports/wms?from=&to=` | The **console-bff** WMS dashboard ([ADR 0003](./adr/0003-console-bff-report-dashboards.md)): three sections — `order-funnel` (order-management `/reports/funnel`), `inventory-flow-accuracy` (inventory-storage `/reports/flow-accuracy`), `catalog-growth` (facility-layout `/reports/catalog-growth`) — each read from that context's separate `*-reports` binary together with its `/freshness` lag. `from`/`to` are optional RFC3339 timestamps (default: trailing 24 h); 400 if either is malformed or `to` is not after `from`. Each section degrades independently (`available: false` + `error`). |
| `GET /console/reports/wes?from=&to=` | The **console-bff** WES dashboard: `planning-throughput` (wes-work-planning `/reports/throughput`), `fulfillment-throughput` (fulfillment-execution `/reports/throughput`), `labor-management` (workforce-management `/reports/labor`), `labor-performance` (labor-performance `/reports/performance`). Same window, validation and per-section degradation as the WMS dashboard. |
| `GET /runtime-signals` | Per-service runtime health for the eight backend contexts (override with `RUNTIME_SIGNALS_SERVICES`) over a 10-minute window: Istio 5xx error rate (`istio_requests_total`) and p99 latency (`istio_request_duration_milliseconds_bucket`) from Prometheus, plus error/fatal log-line counts from Loki (`{namespace="warehouse-systems"}`). Classified by `policy.ClassifyErrorRate` (warning ≥ 1%, critical ≥ 5%) and `policy.ClassifyLatencyP99` (warning ≥ 1000 ms, critical ≥ 3000 ms); any recent error log lifts a service to at least `warning`. A failing Prometheus or Loki query, or an unset `LOKI_URL`, is listed in `unavailableSources` (`prometheus`, `loki`) instead of failing the request; an unset `PROMETHEUS_URL` uses a no-op stub reader, so its metrics read as zero rather than unavailable. 503 if the use case isn't wired. |

## MCP (`internal/adapters/inbound/mcp`)

This agent runs its **own** MCP server (Streamable HTTP, unauthenticated —
see [ADR 0006](./adr/0006-fleet-wide-auth-removal.md)) so that an agentic
host can consume its recommendations the same way it consumes any bounded
context's facts.

| Tool | What it does |
|---|---|
| `get_daily_brief` | Returns the full synthesized `DailyBrief`. |
| `list_open_exceptions` | Lists open exceptions, optionally filtered to a minimum `severity` (`info`/`warning`/`critical`). An unrecognized severity value is rejected, never silently defaulted. |
| `get_flow_balance_exception` | Correlates the E1 signals for one `pathId` (+ `buildingId`/`shiftId` for the staffing lookup) into a ranked `FlowBalanceException`. |
| `explain_travel_factor` | Calls facility-layout's `estimate_travel_distance` for two REQUIRED, caller-supplied location codes (`fromLocationCode`/`toLocationCode`) and classifies the result. The caller must already know both codes — this tool never infers or guesses them (see [ADR 0009](./adr/0009-explain-travel-factor.md)). |

All four tools are annotated read-only
(`mcp.ToolAnnotations{ReadOnlyHint: true}`). This agent has **zero write
tools** — see the [Governance note](./mcp/governance-note.md) for why that
is a v1 design choice, not an oversight.

## What is not yet exposed

The E2 StrandedReservation policy (`internal/domain/policy.Evaluate`) has
an application-layer use case
(`internal/application/usecases.stranded_reservation.go`) but is not yet
wired to either inbound adapter — it is exercised today only by its own
unit tests. Wiring it to a REST route and an MCP tool mirroring
`get_flow_balance_exception`'s shape is open follow-up work, not part of
this documentation pass.
