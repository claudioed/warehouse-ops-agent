# Subdomain classification

`warehouse-ops-agent` is deliberately **not classified** alongside the
fleet's Core/Supporting/Generic subdomains (`inventory-storage` and
`wes-work-planning` as Core; `workforce-management` as Supporting;
`facility-layout` as Generic). Strategic Design classification answers
"whose aggregate is this, and how differentiating is it" — and this repo
owns no aggregate at all.

## What it actually is

A **read-side / decision-support mechanism**: a Customer of five Open
Host Services, correlating their published facts through a pure policy
layer into ranked, human-gated recommendations. In DDD vocabulary this is
closest to a **CQRS read model that spans context boundaries** plus a
**policy** (in the tactical-pattern sense: a strategy object encoding a
business rule) — not a bounded context of its own.

## Why not just call it a sixth bounded context anyway

A bounded context is defined by the aggregate(s) and invariants it
protects. `warehouse-ops-agent` protects none:

- It has no aggregate root, no entity with a lifecycle it enforces.
- It has no invariant a domain-layer method rejects an operation over —
  every rejection in its policy layer (`ParseRebalanceAction`,
  `TaskType.Valid()`) is *input validation at an untrusted boundary*, not
  a business invariant about a domain concept this repo owns.
- It persists no state. Restart it and it has forgotten nothing, because
  it never knew anything that wasn't re-derivable from its five upstream
  reads.

If a future slice ever needs one of those three things — an aggregate, an
invariant, persisted state — [ADR 0001](../adr/0001-warehouse-ops-agent-placement.md)
is explicit that this is the signal that slice belongs in a different
repo (or is itself a new bounded context), not something to smuggle into
this one's policy layer.

## Relationship to the platform's Strategic Design work

The five sibling services' own subdomain classification (see each
service's `docs/ddd/subdomain-classification.md`) is unaffected by this
repo's existence. `warehouse-ops-agent` sits *above* that map as a
cross-cutting Customer, the same relationship `order-management` has to
`fulfillment-execution` and `inventory-storage` — a new repo that
consumes two (there, five) existing contexts' published contracts with no
Go-level dependency on either.
