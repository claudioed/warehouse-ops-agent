# Warehouse Ops Agent

:::warning[Study project]
This documentation site is an educational Domain-Driven Design exercise. It
follows real industry-standard patterns and terminology, but it is **not a
production system** and is **not affiliated with, endorsed by, or
representative of Amazon, Blue Yonder, or any other company**.
:::

**Warehouse Ops Agent** is the fleet's *agentic* layer: the "AI teammate
that sees, analyzes, and recommends" over the five warehouse-systems
bounded contexts (`inventory-storage`, `wes-work-planning`,
`fulfillment-execution`, `workforce-management`, `facility-layout`). It is
a **Customer** of those contexts' published MCP Open Host Services — it
owns no aggregate, enforces no new business invariant, and persists no
domain state. Its "domain" layer is decision **policy**: pure correlation
rules over facts read from the five contexts.

## What it is not

It is **not a sixth bounded context** in the domain sense. See
[ADR 0001](../adr/0001-warehouse-ops-agent-placement.md) for the full
placement reasoning: there is no aggregate or invariant for this repo to
own, so calling it a "context" would be a domain in name only.

## The see → analyze → act surface it consumes

Each of the five sibling contexts already exposes a curated,
intent-level MCP read surface (the fleet's
[MCP Governance Charter](https://claudioed.github.io/fulfillment-execution/docs/mcp/governance-charter)).
This agent's outbound adapters (`internal/adapters/outbound/mcpclient/`)
are thin, schema-typed clients over exactly those tools — never a Go
import of any sibling's internal packages:

| Upstream context | Read tools this agent calls |
|---|---|
| `wes-work-planning` | `get_backlog_telemetry`, `get_rebalance_recommendation` |
| `fulfillment-execution` | `get_queue_status`, `find_claimable_work`, `diagnose_stuck_tasks` |
| `inventory-storage` | `check_availability`, `get_bin_occupancy` |
| `workforce-management` | `get_staffing_gap`, `propose_path_heads` |
| `facility-layout` | `list_sites`, `get_site_layout`, `get_zone_grid` |

"Analyze" is the pure `internal/domain/policy` correlation layer described
below. "Act" is deliberately **not built yet** — see
[Governance note](../mcp/governance-note.md#v1-scope-read-only-recommendations-only).

## The three exceptions

| Exception | What it correlates | Recommended action |
|---|---|---|
| **E1 — FlowBalanceException** | wes's rebalance recommendation + workforce-management's staffing gap + fulfillment-execution's stuck-task diagnostic, for one process path | `assign_labor`, `release_next_work`, or `hold` |
| **E2 — StrandedReservation** | fulfillment-execution's expired/expiring task leases + inventory-storage's usable-stock shortfall for the affected SKU | `revoke_reservation` (with a mandatory blast-radius readout) or `hold` |
| **E3 — DailyBrief** | backlog telemetry, staffing gap, queue depth, and stuck-task counts across every monitored path, grouped by facility-layout site | flags a path an **open exception** only when **two or more independent signals** correlate — never a single metric alone |

Every decision this agent returns carries its full **evidence trail**
(which upstream tool reading drove the call) and degrades to a
conservative `hold` — never a guess — whenever a signal it needs is
unavailable. See [Domain vision](../business-context/domain-vision.md) for
why that degrade-to-hold discipline is the whole point of the design.

## Where to go next

- [Getting started](./getting-started.md) — run it locally.
- [Domain vision](../business-context/domain-vision.md) — why this agent
  exists the way it does, and the guardrails that keep it that way.
- [Ubiquitous language](../business-context/ubiquitous-language.md) — the
  exact vocabulary this service uses, including the terms it borrows from
  its five upstream contexts.
- [API surface](../api-surface.md) — the REST and MCP tools this agent
  exposes.
- [Context map](../ecosystem/context-map.md) — how this agent sits among
  the five bounded contexts.
- [Governance note](../mcp/governance-note.md) — the read-only v1 posture
  and what a future write-capable slice would require.
- [Architecture Decision Records](../adr/index.md) — the decisions, and why.
