// the caller must always supply explicitly) and two facility-layout
// location codes, it calls estimate_travel_distance and returns the
// resulting policy.TravelFactorCorrelation alongside the raw reading.
//
// This use case deliberately never infers, guesses, or resolves a
// location code on the caller's behalf: fulfillment-execution's Station
// aggregate has an optional locationCode field (see that repo's ADR
// 0024) but no published MCP tool surfaces it today, so there is no live
// wire path from "this stuck task/path" to "these two location codes" —
// see ADR 0009's Context for the full reasoning. A caller who does not
// already know both codes cannot use this use case, and it will not
// pretend otherwise.
