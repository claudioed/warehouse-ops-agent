// Package policy: daily-brief (E3) correlation rules.
//
// This file adds the pure, side-effect-free types and correlation logic
// behind the synthesized daily operational brief: per-path facts gathered
// from the five bounded contexts (via internal/ports client interfaces, one
// layer out in internal/application/usecases), and a small set of
// deterministic rules that flag a path as an open exception worth a human's
// attention.
//
// Every type here is a plain value — no ports import, no I/O — per the
// hexagonal dependency rule this package enforces on itself (see this
// package's doc.go and internal/architecture/architecture_test.go's
// "domain (policy) has no internal dependencies except domain").

// queue name (PICK/PACK/SLAM), and workforce-management's
// (BuildingId, ShiftId, PathId) staffing-gap key, grouped under the
// facility-layout SiteCode it physically belongs to.
//
// These identifiers are NOT guaranteed equal across contexts — each
// bounded context owns its own ubiquitous language — so wiring which wes
// PathId corresponds to which fe queue and which workforce-management path
// is a deployment-time configuration concern (internal/config), never
// something this policy package infers.
