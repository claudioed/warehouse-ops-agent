### The two outbound adapter families are deliberately not unified

`mcpclient` (synchronous MCP tool calls, at request time, backing the
decision-support use cases and the LLM reasoner's tool use) and
`restclient` (plain HTTP calls backing the `console-bff` fan-out) answer
different questions for different callers — an LLM host asking "what needs
attention right now" versus a browser asking "what happened to order X".
See [context-map.md](docs/docs/ecosystem/context-map.md) for the full
Mermaid diagram and the per-context MCP-tool / REST-endpoint table.

### Runtime signals (`GET /runtime-signals`)

`usecases.RuntimeSignals` reads Istio request metrics from Prometheus
(`istio_requests_total` 5xx fraction, `istio_request_duration_milliseconds_bucket`
p99) per service over a 10-minute window, plus error/fatal lines from Loki
scoped to `RUNTIME_SIGNALS_NAMESPACE`. The only decision is in
`policy/runtime_signals.go`: error rate warning ≥ 1% / critical ≥ 5%, p99
warning ≥ 1000 ms / critical ≥ 3000 ms, and any recent error log lifts a
service to at least `warning`. A failing Prometheus/Loki query (or unset
`LOKI_URL`) is reported in `unavailableSources`, never a request failure;
an unset `PROMETHEUS_URL` uses the stub reader (metrics read as 0).

### Model-backed reasoner (ADR 0004)

`GET /flow-balance/{pathId}` can consult a real Anthropic model behind the
deterministic policy layer. `policy.Decide` (deterministic) always runs
first; `LLM_MODE` controls what the model's plan may do with the result:

| `LLM_MODE` | behaviour |
|---|---|
| `off` (default) | model never called; byte-for-byte pre-ADR-0004 behaviour |
| `shadow` | model called, plan logged + counted (`ops_agent_llm_agreement_total{agree}`), deterministic decision still returned |
| `on` | a schema-valid plan replaces action/heads/rationale; deterministic decision is the fallback on error, timeout, or out-of-vocabulary output (logged `source=fallback`) |

The model's **only actuators are MCP read tools** (`LLM_TOOL_ALLOWLIST`,
comma-separated `<upstream>/<tool>`), invoked through the exact same
`mcpclient` sessions the deterministic path uses, schema-validated on every
call, and logged as `llm.tool_call`. It answers only through a
`submit_plan` tool whose schema is `policy`'s closed action vocabulary;
`policy.ValidatePlan`/`policy.Arbitrate` reject anything outside it. An
unrecognized `LLM_MODE` is a **startup error**, never a silent fallback to
`off`; a non-`off` mode with no `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is also a startup
error. See
[ADR 0004](docs/docs/adr/0004-llm-reasoner-behind-the-policy-layer.md) for
the full design and rationale.
